HOW TO RUN:
	
	In order to actually run the program, just run the main file and it will pop-up with an 
	output screen that updates until it is finished. 
	
	In order to change the paths that the ore will take there is a paths.txt file that needs 
	to be edited. There are 3 machine paths, 4 furnaces, and 3 generator types. These can be 
	combined for the different paths the ores take. To change the path edit the paths.txt file 
	to look like the following:
	
	pitsgm1f1
	g1
	
	The first line is the machine paths and the furnaces. Edit the "m1" to be m1, m2, or m3 in 
	order to change the machine path that the ore takes. Edit the "f1" to be f1, f2, f3, or f4
	in order to change the furnace that the ore goes to. Edit the "g1" in the second line to be
	g1, g2, or g3 for the different generator types. There will always be an "EU" generator 
	available to run, so this just changes the "RF" generator type. The file 
	MinecraftDataSheet.xlsx contains the different machine paths, furnaces, and generator types 
	all in different pages of the file. Refer to that file in order to see what the path is.
